  "description": "The Lightning is a WRL-homologated T-180 racing vehicle designed by Sakai Engineering. The team at Sakai, traditionalists though they are, were the first team to pick up Racer Motors' field-sweeping concept of jet propulsion on a top-level racecar. This car has seen some upgrades since their initial experiments, the last of which was the now-standard T-180 all-wheel-steer system: for the longest time, the team thought the system was an 'overcomplicated handicap that is no replacement for proper car design'. Even Duggery claimed back in '98 that 'these computers are for teams that can't build engines'. They gave in after a year of failing to qualify for any mainline events. Staying true to what they know to work, the current car uses a GP-style twin-annealed bodyshell on a ruggedized monocoque chassis, with a massive rear wing and side strakes to keep it stable on the track and in the air. Torque output comes from a quad-overbored, pressure-injected, carbureted V12; with a single-spool centrifugally-spun overcharger turbine providing cornering thrust.",
