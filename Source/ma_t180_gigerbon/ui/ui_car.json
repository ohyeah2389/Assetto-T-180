  "description": "This car is a collaboration between Mad Agus and ohyeah2389. Mad Agus made the 3D model of the car, while ohyeah2389 made the physics and sound of the car.<br><br>The Gigerbon is a special version of Prince Kabala Motors' T-180 racing vehicle made for Prince Kabala himself. The vehicle is adorned with many large gemstones, jewels, and diamonds, famously placing the vehicle's estimated construction cost over 22 million dollars. Asides from the visual distinction over the standard Kabala Motors T-180, the vehicle is also outfitted with some special performance modifications, such as core-lightened titanium-osmium-weave longerons, beryllium plating on the turbine blade tips, and ECU tuning to use a higher-grade propellant than can normally be used in the production model's Uniron-derived V10 hotblock. Notably absent is the WRL's stock tire; Kabala has arranged a special exemption with the WRL to allow his team to run their own mixture of tire compound. Kabala's team claims that the manganese ammonium pyrophosphate dopant added in the manufacturing of the tire is purely for visuals and should not provide any difference in performance.",
