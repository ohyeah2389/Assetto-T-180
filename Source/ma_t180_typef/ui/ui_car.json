  "description": "This car is a collaboration between Mad Agus and ohyeah2389. Mad Agus made the 3D model of the car, while ohyeah2389 made the physics and sound of the car.<br><br>Designed and manufactured by G&#246;delian Autonomics, this WRL-homologated T-180 racing vehicle has clearly been optimized for its price-to-performance ratio, allowing new teams a low barrier-to-entry into the top level of WRL competition. <br><br>G&#246;delian is known for their innovative, logical, and well-researched engineering concepts, and this design is nothing but their finest work. Among its unconventional but clever features are its fiberplate-core aerodynamic wheel covers, a set of computationally-optimized aerodynamic elements, forged-titanium friction-damped control arms, and an interlocking heave/sway compensator system for the four-stage higher-multipole-accelerated hadron injection drive, which reliably provides crosscoupled boost-effect from the jet thrusters to the bespoke long-throw V12. The system is suprisingly reliable, and while it doesn&#39;t provide championship-sweeping levels of performance, it is fuel-efficient, easy to repair, and cheap to replace (if your competition is a bit too bone-headed).",
