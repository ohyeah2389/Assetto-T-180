  "description": "This car is a collaboration between Mad Agus and ohyeah2389. Mad Agus made the 3D model of the car, while ohyeah2389 made the physics and sound of the car.<br><br>The Type C is Prince Kabala Motors' WRL-homologated T-180 racing vehicle designed to compete in the WRL championship racing series. Similar to the Type A, it is the generic, customer-racing version of the company's flagship T-180, Kabala's Gigerbon. It uses a V10 hotblock design licensed and further developed from the legacy Uniron powerplant seen often in the previous generation of top-level WRL racing vehicles. Despite its age, the design is reliable and performant, though it does not integrate well with the somewhat standard axial-flow single-stage twin turbojet thrusters mounted on either side of it. For torque distribution, the vehicle makes use of a Royalton-forged wireless induction transponder, the license fees for which make up the bulk of the vehicle's higher-than-standard purchase price.",
