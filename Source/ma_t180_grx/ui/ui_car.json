  "description": "This car is a collaboration between Mad Agus and ohyeah2389. Mad Agus made the 3D model of the car, while ohyeah2389 made the physics and sound of the car.<br><br>The GRX is a WRL-homologated T-180 racing vehicle designed by Royalton Industries to compete in the WRL championship racing series. It uses a highly advanced inter-positive longitudinal transponder for networked torque management and delivery, eight heat-exchange ports which generate directed thrust, and twenty-four ground effect elements to glue it to any racing surface. It features Royalton's patented 'T-360' system, consisting of a linear wave-shaped power induction-transmission system, allowing for limitless per-wheel steering angle command from the car's central computer on account of the lack of driveshafts, geartrains, or belt-drives. The exterior metallic elements are coated in 2-micron copper-gold plating, complementing the car's platinum-flake velvet purple paint.",
