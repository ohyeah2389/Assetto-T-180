  "description": "Looking like it would prefer to be on the QRA ready ramp at Dreamland or escorting Megafortresses over the Indian Ocean, the Talon brings next-generation air supremacy down to your nearest WRL-sanctioned racetrack. The car has foregone the traditional prime mover for a pair of absurdly oversized jet turbines lifted straight from the military-industrial complex's latest aerial dominance project. No expense has been spared in the design and construction of this experiment on wheels: kev-light-fiber body panels, micro-polished ceramic bushings, a quintuple-redundant control computer, radar-absorbent paint, and divertless supersonic inlets. I'd share more info, but you don't have the security clearance to know about it.
