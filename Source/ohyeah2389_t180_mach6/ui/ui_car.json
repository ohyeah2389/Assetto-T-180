  "description": "The Mach 6 is a WRL-homologated T-180 racing vehicle designed by Pops Racer and built by the Racer family to compete in the WRL championship racing series. It is outfitted with a Bernoulli convergenator for direct rearward thrust as well as pressure application to a V8 engine routed through a linearly shifted mechanical drivetrain for combined, easy-to-operate thrust and torque instead of the state-of-the-art generator-transponder-thruster setup. A hand-laid carbon composite tub forms the core of the chassis, with a framework of hand-welded nitronium tubes supporting the metallitized fiberglass exterior shell, forming one of the few remaining closed-wheel T-180 designs. Engineered wood can even be found in some weight-sensitive areas of the car, along with bio-derived lubricants and oils used in the hydraulic system powering the steering servos and the jump jacks.",
