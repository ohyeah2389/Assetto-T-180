  "description": "This car is a collaboration between Mad Agus and ohyeah2389. Mad Agus made the 3D model of the car, while ohyeah2389 made the physics and sound of the car.<br><br>The Augury is Racer X's T-180. Developed in collaboration with the C.I.B. and the brilliant chemist and theoretical physicist Minx, the Augury features a next-generation Godelian Survival Cell grafted to an Encooler DX Porting Sequencer. Every component of the car down to the joint system in the wheelbase is made of composite core, making it lightweight for its class. It also features a Dragster Drive Computer, which pushes the vehicle's Apache block to an MPS figure not attainable in heavier cars, along with inter-optic analysis metering equipment keeping the wheels in direct contact with what is thought to be an optimized fuel cell multiplexer. A loud and proud car, it also features an innovative composite muffler system on the underside.",
