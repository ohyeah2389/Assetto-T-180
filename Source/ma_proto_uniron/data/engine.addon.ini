INERTIA=0.15 ; engine inertia
LIMITER=12000 ; engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter

[COAST_REF]
RPM=7000 ; rev number reference
TORQUE=100 ; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference

LAG_DN=0.9982
LAG_UP=0.9945
MAX_BOOST=0.825 ; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=1.0 ; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=0.825 ; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM=9000 ; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal).
